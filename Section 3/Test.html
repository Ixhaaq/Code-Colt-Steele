    <p>Ferrari S.p.A. (/fəˈrɑːri/; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in
        Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988) in 1939 from the Alfa Romeo racing division as Auto Avio
        Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first Ferrari-badged car in 1947.</p>

    <p>Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[4] In October 2014, Fiat
        Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the announcement
        FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.[5][6][7] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established
        Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari S.p.A.
        group,[8] and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares
        on the New York Stock Exchange.[9] Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's
        business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[10] The
        spin-off was completed on the 3rd of January 2016.[9]</p>

    <p>Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in
        Formula One, where it is the oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors'
        championships (16) and having produced the highest number of drivers' championship wins (15).[11] Ferrari road
        cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.[12] Ferrari cars are built at the 165,000
        square-metre (16.5-hectare) Maranello factory.[13] In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by
        Brand Finance.[14] As of 2021, Ferrari is the 10th-largest car manufacturer by market capitalisation, with
        $52.21 billion.[15]</p>
